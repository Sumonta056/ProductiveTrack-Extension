# Chrome Extension for Tracking Website Visits

This Chrome extension tracks the number of times you visit each website and the total time you spend on each site. It displays this information in a popup when you click on the extension icon.

## Setup

1. **Download the extension files:** Download the extension files from the GitHub repository and extract them to a folder on your computer.

2. **Load the extension into Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
   - Enable Developer mode by clicking the toggle switch at the top right.
   - Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the folder where you extracted the extension files.

## Usage

1. **Visit websites:** As you browse the web, the extension will automatically track the number of times you visit each website and the total time you spend on each site.

2. **View your browsing data:** Click on the extension icon to open a popup that displays a table of all the websites you've visited, along with the visit count and time spent for each site.

3. **Clear your browsing data:** If you want to clear your browsing data, click the `Clear Data` button in the popup. This will delete all the data the extension has collected.

## Note

This extension uses the Chrome `storage.local` API to store your browsing data. This means that your data is stored locally on your computer and is not sent to any external servers. The extension does not collect any personal information and does not track your browsing history when you're in incognito mode.

Please remember to respect user privacy and use this extension responsibly.
